# New XProgramming Project

I am working with Bill Tozier and others on new software for the XProgramming.com site. This is the GitHub repository for the project.

It's not really intended for publication or cloning (and right now you'd be a fool to use it) but feel free to look around if you care to. 

Soon we'll push the site somewhere, and there are articles about the project in the project, so it will document some of what we're doing. We don't promise to document everything.
